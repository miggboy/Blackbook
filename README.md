# Blackbook
Contact Management System.

Blackbook is a contact management application. Create contacts with attributes such as names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, and more.

App should be run from app/build/libs, with the package matching your operating system. Jar build is standalone and can be transferred to any other location as long as java 17 is present. gradlew run will clear saved data during tests. Automatic builds are saved under the "Run builds on merge" action, and precompiled jars can be acquired through the artifacts there.
